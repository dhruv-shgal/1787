Advanced Police Name Search System
This project tackles the challenges faced by police departments when handling names, particularly Hindi names, which often have multiple transliterations, phonetic similarities, and can be recorded in different scripts. These issues affect the accuracy and efficiency of name matching processes, leading to operational delays and inefficiencies.

Features
Fuzzy Matching Algorithms: Capable of handling variations in spelling, transliteration, and phonetic similarities.
Standardized Transliteration: Rules for consistent Hindi to English transliteration to avoid inconsistencies.
Phonetic Search: Search capabilities that consider phonetic similarities for more accurate results.
Error Correction Mechanisms: Helps rectify common data entry mistakes.
Script Interoperability: Supports searches across Devanagari (Hindi script) and Roman (English script).
Training Guidelines: Best practices for entering and managing name data.
Issues Addressed
Inconsistent Transliteration: Multiple valid transliterations for the same Hindi name (e.g., "Suresh" and "Sursh").
Spelling Variations: Small differences in spelling cause discrepancies in the database.
Phonetic Similarity: Similar-sounding names, like "Kumar" and "Kumaar," are treated as distinct entries.
Data Entry Errors: Human mistakes during data entry introduce further variations.
Multiple Scripts: Handling names recorded in both Devanagari and Roman scripts.
Search Efficiency: Traditional search algorithms struggle with these variations, leading to inefficiencies.
HTML Overview
The HTML interface provides two main functionalities:

Name Search: Allows users to search for names in either Hindi or English. It uses fuzzy matching and transliteration to handle different variations and scripts.
Add New Name: Users can add new names to the database, including related names, to improve future search results.
How It Works
Name Search: Enter a name in Hindi or English, and the system will perform transliteration and search the database for matching or related names. It displays results with both the Hindi and English name forms along with related names.

Add New Name: Users can add names to the database in both Hindi and English, along with any known related name variations.

Technologies Used
HTML/CSS: For structuring and styling the web interface.
JavaScript: Used for implementing search functionalities, including transliteration, fuzzy matching, and UI interactivity.
Fuse.js: A lightweight fuzzy-search library to handle name variations.
Particles.js: Adds a visually appealing particle effect to the background.
Transliteration.js: Handles the conversion between Hindi and English scripts.
